I can't know where is the bug, that make the NickNameInUseTest, fails sometimes and passes sometimes, without changing a line the code, and the tester was the only socket prgram I use, this happened with some of my friends

New Classes:

1. Settings: this class carries the functions of loading and saving the settings.txt file, which carry the serverPath and solPath, so that I don't enter them every time
2. Configuration: is the Object the Settings class use to read and write the settings.txt file
3. TestUtility: carries the functions considering the ID's of each Test in an Enum, gets a test from an ID, or a TestType object
4. Logger: Logging the Runs

Changes In MainForm: every change is stated in the code as // TODO Comments and regions

Running:
Before and After any Run, "PreRun" & "PostRun" should be called

Logging Files:
