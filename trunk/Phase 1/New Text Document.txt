		Unkown Points:

-if command is accepted, what should be the return ex: OK

-What to do with the ClientID in Session Class

-What to do with the ServerName Parameter in the User Command that client sends me.

-What to do if the NickName's User isn't registered, the distination client sent NickCommand only.

-If in PrivMsg I received 1 param, What error should I return: ERR_NORECIPIENT (0);;ERR_NOTEXTTOSEND(1)
Behavior with other commands

-For all other commands, your server must return ERR_UNKNOWNCOMMAND. If you are unable to implement one of the
above commands (perhaps you ran out of time), your server must return the error code ERR_UNKNOWNCOMMAND, rather
than failing silently, or in some other manner

-In PrivMsg, if the first 2 targets are available, but the third isn't, should I send the message to the avaible only, or send to all, if all and all only are available
